                          Adventour is an idea that I have had for a couple of months now. I like to analyze potential trends and services that may 
                          be valuable to potential clients. For the past two years the world has experienced feelings of isolation and loneliness due 
                          to COVID-19 pandemic. Eventually, when the world is ready, people will begin to travel, and a need to see the world again 
                          will arise.
                        </p>
                        <p className='gap'>
                          To meet this demand, I planned out Adventour to alleviate the stresses associated with itinerary planning. I originally 
                          worked on this project briefly at Shell Hacks 2021 where it was a very minimal web application. After hearing the pitches 
                          for Senior Design I from sponsors, I was not impressed. I have a habit of always trying to be unique and original so I 
                          tried my best to settle on a sponsor project and work on an idea that wasn't necessarily mine. However, when all of the 
                          sponsored projects were completed and I still had not resonated with any of them, I knew I had to propose the Adventour 
                          project.
                        </p>
                        <p className='gap'>
                          I believe this project will give me an amazing opportunity to learn about new technologies and make me a better software
                          engineer. I am fortunate enough to have been assigned an outstanding group of individuals for teammates who I know want to 
                          do Adventour justice just as much as I do.</p>

                            I’ll be honest. I wasn’t really concerned with the project I was going to end up on. I didn’t have anything that I was 
                            super interested in, so I was willing to work on pretty much any project as long as I could have a trustworthy and 
                            dependable team so that we could finish it and move on with our lives. The projects that I saw struck me as boring, way 
                            out of my comfort zone, or just seemed like I was automating someone's job. 
                          </p>
                          <p className='gap'> 
                            When Wanyea proposed Adventour it was the first 
                            project that actually seemed interesting, useful, and fun to work on. It seemed like Adventour was something that he 
                            actually wanted to turn into a useful tool to help people, and that made me want to help him with it. He said he was 
                            looking for people who were passionate more than he was looking for people with outstanding technical abilities and that 
                            made me confident that I would find good teammates who would contribute and work as a team. 
                          </p>
                          <p className='gap'>
                            I’m happy that this is the 
                            group that I ended up with. Everyone seems driven and friendly, and I’m excited about what we’re building and hope that 
                            we’ll be able to make Adventour a reality.

                              The main thing that got me excited for Adventour was that during the pitch, I asked the presenter and our Project 
                              Manager, Wanyea, what kind of group-mates he was looking for. If I were to get into a group, my priority was to be of 
                              help to the rest of the team, hoping I would be a good fit. So I was happy to hear that Wanyea was looking for those 
                              who would be passionate about working on this project. After hearing that, I felt that I would have the freedom to 
                              learn and grow with the team. It calmed my worries that I would not be able to contribute to the project, and my mind 
                              freely raced with ideas for Adventour.

                              I like the purpose of ease-of-living mobile apps. They do not pretend to be revolutionary, but developing them would 
                              still give us the space to be creative. As someone who struggles with creating itineraries for my family, partners, 
                              and friends, Adventour sounded like it was made for me. Being an immigrant and constantly traveling makes it tough to 
                              ensure fun destinations, even for local spots. My family and I love to travel, and my sister is usually left with the 
                              duties to create the perfect travel plans. If I could help develop something that makes it easier for us, I would be 
                              grateful. I believe that Adventour would help me grow as a developer and a designer. And if we successfully create 
                              Adventour, we would be able to make travel fun and easier for all.

                        At the beginning of the semester, I was asked by some classmates to join their Senior Design project idea, and I loved it. 
                        I thought it was a great idea that had plenty of potential for the future, so I jumped on board with them. Before sponsored 
                        project pitches finished, the team disbanded for personal reasons, and I was left having to consider a heap of project 
                        pitches that I just was not interested in.
                      </p>
                      <p className='gap'> 
                        Immediately upon hearing Wanyea’s pitch, I wrote it down as my number one choice. My girlfriend and I love traveling. 
                        We spend as much of our free time as we can visiting new places and experiencing the local businesses and culture. It 
                        can be difficult to create a full day of plans and includes having to sift through various blogs to figure out what is 
                        available and affordable for us to do on our trips.

                        Wanyea’s Adventour app aims to solve these problems for its users. The most important quality when choosing a Senior Design 
                        project for myself was to work on something that I would enjoy using. I want to be a part of a project that will have a 
                        lasting impact on my life and travel is the best way to do that. Adventour gave me the best opportunity to work closely with 
                        something I love doing and to get experience working on a full stack project.

                            Adventour stood out to me as an application that I would genuinely be interested in using. As someone who traveled 
                            frequently pre-COVID, I know how difficult it can be to find good destinations in an unfamiliar place. 
                          </p>
                          <p className="gap">
                            When I heard Wanyea’s pitch, I thought it was a great idea. Instead of spending my time researching cities that I am in 
                            to find a good coffee shop near my stay or the best local bakery around, why not automate it? Despite my main interests 
                            being in computer vision and artificial intelligence, I wanted in on this project because it felt personal to me. 
                          </p>
                          <p className="gap">
                            I see Adventour having the potential to change the way people travel. I know that I am not the only person who spends 
                            too much time planning their trips. I also know that many people do not take the time to find nice, unique establishments
                            en they are in a new place and instead opt for fast food. I think that Adventour helps solve both of these issues at once. 
                            By having a source that I know I can trust and that is tailored to my tastes, I can definitely see myself and many others 
                            saving a lot of time that would otherwise be spent planning trips

                          Adventour was one of my highest choices for a project because I believe it is a genuinely well thought out, concrete idea 
                          that could realistically prove useful to many users. My experience planning trips has proven to me that itinerary scheduling 
                          is still a very unoptimized and arduous process, making it seem like something that would obviously benefit from a streamlined 
                          application.

                          Wanyea’s original pitch of generating full-day plans for users seemed like the kind of thing that would impress my parents 
                          (who I could see using an application like this), but the swiping-style system that we’ve come to settle on seems to offer much 
                          more utility and will probably even be more computationally straightforward to implement.

                        <p className="gap">
                          Even outside of planning vacations, I would love to have an app like this to plan day trips to other cities, or even just to 
                          fill up a day off with new things I can experience in my own city. If the algorithm could effectively predict things that I 
                          enjoy after continued use, the functionality provided by the map could outweigh maybe even my own efforts to research 
                          interesting things to do through sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor.
